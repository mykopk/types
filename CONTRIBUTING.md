## Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive experience for everyone. Be respectful, constructive, and professional. Harassment, trolling, and personal attacks will not be tolerated.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mykopk/types.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the package (CJS + ESM + DTS)
npm run build

# Watch mode
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck
```

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── db/           # Database-related type definitions
└── eo/           # Ecosystem One type definitions
```

## Coding Standards

- **Language**: TypeScript with strict mode
- **Formatting**: Follow the existing code style
- **Typing**: Prefer explicit interfaces over inline types for public APIs
- **Naming**:
  - Interfaces/types: PascalCase
  - Functions/variables: camelCase
  - Files: kebab-case
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Exports**: Named exports only (no default exports)
- **Comments**: JSDoc for all public APIs; minimal inline comments

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

- Write tests for every new type or utility
- Use Vitest (the project's test runner)
- Place tests next to the source file as `*.test.ts`

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`
2. Run `npm run build && npm test` — all tests must pass
3. Run `npm run typecheck` — no type errors
4. Keep PRs focused: one feature or fix per PR
5. Write a clear PR description explaining what and why
6. Link any related issues

### PR title format

```
feat: add [feature]
fix: fix [bug description]
docs: update [documentation]
chore: [maintenance task]
refactor: [refactoring description]
